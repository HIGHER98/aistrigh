Needs doing...
- [ ] Account for notes off the "main" staff. 
- [ ] Transcribe to a legible output
  - Maybe tabs
  - Maybe some machine-legible way 
- [ ] Write unit tests
  - De-fluff code
  - Flags for running the code
    - `image [input image]`
    - `output [to save output files/notes??]`
    - `format [notes/guitar tab/something else?]`
- [ ] Eventually, recognise note durations [characters] (maybe using an SVM)
- [ ] Better setup for debugging visually (trackbars)
- [ ] Maybe an API to query for the data if I wanted to put this online somewhere
